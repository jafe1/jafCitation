Drawing on the <a href="/topics/psychology/construal" title="Learn more about construal from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">construal</a> level theory and the elaboration likelihood model, this study investigates the interactive effects between visual and verbal framing of promotional tourism short video on travel intention through two scenario-based experiments. Study 1 examined the interaction effect between visual perspective and visual content. The results indicated that the match between first-person (</span><em>versus</em> third-person) perspective and activity-centric (<em>versus</em> site-centric) content fosters higher travel intention through enhancing imagery fluency. Study 2 further examined the moderating role of narration message appeal and revealed that first-person perspective with activity-centric content leads to higher travel intention when paired with rational (<em>versus</em> emotional) narration messages, with affect intensity playing a significant mediating role. These findings contribute to knowledge on short video marketing and provide valuable insights for tourism marketers.</div></div></div></div>

<div class="PageDivider"></div><div class="Introduction u-font-serif u-margin-l-ver"><h2 class="u-h4 u-margin-s-bottom">Introduction</h2><section id="sec1"><div class="u-margin-s-bottom" id="p0010">Along with the pervasive use of mobile smart devices and social networks, short videos on mobile social platforms have become increasingly popular (Vandersmissen, Godin, Tomar, Neve, &amp; Walle, 2014). Short videos shared by travel &amp; tourism organizations on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat provide good access for individuals to watch video clips of short duration, from 15�&nbsp;s to 1�&nbsp;min (Lu &amp; Lu, 2019). The format and time of short videos well accommodate the contemporary lifestyle of travellers. Short videos are re-shaping people's lifestyles and influencing their travel preferences (Du, Liechty, Santos, &amp; Park, 2020). For example, in 2020, a short video about a young boy named Ding Zhen, with his charming smile and beautiful hometown, attracted explosive interest from TikTok users. With billions of views in just 18 days, Ding Zhen's hometown, a niche county town called Litang, became a hot tourism destination. After that, a series of short promotional videos produced by Litang County attracted more than 1.512 million tourists that year and increased local tourism income by 72.4% (Bytedance, 2021).</div><div class="u-margin-s-bottom" id="p0015">Tourism researchers have demonstrated the favorable effects of short videos on destination promotion (Kim, Choe, &amp; Lee, 2018; Shao, Li, Morrison, &amp; Wu, 2016). Unlike other marketing videos, short videos must grasp consumers' attention and interest in a very limited time by combining sounds, images, and storylines (Huang, Chen, &amp; Wang, 2012). While previous research on promotional videos mainly discussed their strategic use during the Covid-19 Pandemic (Ketter &amp; Avraham, 2021) or the traditional elements in relatively long marketing videos (i.e., narratives, characters, story plot and the like) (Moin, Hosany, &amp; O’Brien, 2020), little research has investigated the role of visual (Mele, Filieri, &amp; De Carlo, 2023) and auditory cues in short videos developed for social media platforms.</div><div class="u-margin-s-bottom" id="p0020">As noted by Huang, Xie, and Liu (2021), short videos rely heavily on shooting operations and key audio-visual elements (e.g., language style, semantic design, and camera angle) to achieve the best effects. Particularly, the visual perspective is regarded as an effective shooting skill that can optimize the presentation of visual content in a short video (e.g., Hur, Lim, &amp; Lyu, 2020; Libby, Shaeffer, &amp; Eibach, 2009; Zhang &amp; Yang, 2015). The visual perspective is an image presentation method in which different points of view are presented in the video by changing the visual angles (Hung &amp; Mukhopadhyay, 2012; Zhang &amp; Yang, 2015), which has a great impact on consumers' information processing and meaning construction (Libby &amp; Eibach, 2011; Soliman, Buehler, &amp; Peetz, 2017). Different from other forms of media, such as static photos and broadcasts, short videos rely heavily on manipulating the visual perspective to provide tourists with visual experiences. A video that makes appropriate use of shooting skills can quickly capture audiences’ attention and interest (Zhang &amp; Yang, 2015), enhancing the promotional efficacy of short videos.</div><div class="u-margin-s-bottom" id="p0025">Scholars identified two types of visual perspectives: a first-person and a third-person visual perspective (Zhang &amp; Yang, 2015). The first-person visual perspective directs individuals to see an event through their own eyes as part of the audience, while the third-person visual perspective directs individuals to observe the event from an external perspective (Zhang &amp; Yang, 2015). The two perspectives play a different influence on individuals' memory retrieval (Nigro &amp; Neisser, 1983), imagination (Batson, Early, &amp; Salvarani, 1997), emotional state and event representation (Libby &amp; Eibach, 2011). Appropriately used visual perspectives can facilitate viewers' information processing in regards to quickly getting audiences' attention and interest (Hur et al., 2020), which has great potential to impact the promotion effectiveness of short videos. Examining how different visual perspectives in tourism short videos exert diverse impacts on tourists’ information processing and evaluation is thus of great value to further understand the power of visual experience in tourism video marketing.</div>
<div class="u-margin-s-bottom" id="p0030">Further, studies have argued that the analysis of the persuasiveness of visual perspectives should be extended to different product categories (Hur et al., 2020; Zhang &amp; Yang, 2015). When promoting the tourist destination, different elements of tourist attractions (e.g., recreational activities and destination scenery) serve as key visual content presentations of tourism products in short videos (Xu, Chen, Pearce, Mohammadi, &amp; Pearce, 2021). Thus, in our study, we expect that the effectiveness of visual perspectives depends largely on the visual content being presented in the short video (Filieri, Lin, Pino, Alguezaui, &amp; Inversini, 2021). Prior research indicated that different presentations of tourist attractions might influence the information processing styles tourists use to understand those attractions (Byun &amp; Jang, 2015; Hlee, Lee, Koo, &amp; Chung, 2021). Accordingly, recreational activities and destination scenery presented in short videos through appropriate shooting perspectives could better facilitate tourists' imagination of the travel experience in the destination, possibly strengthening their willingness to travel (Xu et al., 2021). While the visual content of tourism videos can be generally categorized as site-centric and activity-centric in terms of destination showcasing (Tussyadiah &amp; Fesenmaier, 2009), it is not clear how different visual perspectives may alter the impacts of different visual content in a short video on tourists’ attitude and behavioral intention.</div><div class="u-margin-s-bottom" id="p0035">Except for the visual elements, narration messages in tourism short videos are alternatively important verbal components because they can convey rich product information and provide important interpretative descriptions of the visual content (Filieri et al., 2021; Kim &amp; Lennon, 2008). Therefore, voice-over narrations as additional audio presentation of messages could offer corresponding audio explanations to the visual content of videos (Kim &amp; Youn, 2017), potentially influencing the promotion effects of tourism short videos. Message appeals, such as rational and emotional appeals, are crucial in determining the communication effectiveness of verbal messages (Wang, Kirillova, &amp; Lehto, 2017; Zhang, Sun, Liu, &amp; Knight, 2014). Specifically, rational appeals focus on concrete and tangible physical features and quantities, while emotional appeals center on the desirability of obtaining or using the product (Kim, Lee, &amp; Choi, 2019). Given that narration messages in tourism short videos serve as important verbal elements that complement visual elements (i.e., content and perspective), how different message appeals moderate the interactive effect between visual perspective and visual content on tourists’ behavioral intention deserves further understanding.</div><div class="u-margin-s-bottom" id="p0040">Utilizing the construal level theory (CLT) (Liberman &amp; Trope, 2008), the current study first investigates the underlying mechanisms through which matches between visual perspectives (first-person vs. third-person) and visual content (activity-centric vs. site-centric) induce different construal levels (concrete vs. abstract) in processing tourism short videos and jointly impact the promotion effect. Drawing upon the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) (Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986), we further uncover how tourists’ information elaboration of verbal elements (i.e., narration message) in tourism short videos interacts with construal levels induced by visual elements to produce additive effects.</div><div class="u-margin-s-bottom" id="p0045">This study is expected to extend the destination promotion literature from the perspective of short video marketing by analyzing different roles played by visual perspectives, visual content, and verbal components. The results also make an important addition and extension to the construal level theory and elaboration likelihood model by empirically verifying the interaction between construal mindsets and information elaborations in influencing tourists’ processing of tourism short videos. Our study can also provide treasured implications for marketers in designing effective promotional tourism short videos.</div></section></div>
